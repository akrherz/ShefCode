Updates to the Shefpars Code

28 Feb 2007

Several source files were changed to address the following problems:

Need to correctly handle the new Daylight Saving Time definition which takes
effect on 11 March 2007.

When a valid ".B" statement with a closing ".END" is followed by an invalid ".B"
statement the data values in the invalid ".B" statement are read in as though
the original ".END" statement was not read.

When the TZ code of L or LS are used in Alaska the parser interprets the wrong Z
time.  The shef message observation goes into the database an hour after it
should. 

None of these changes require any change to the instructions for building or
using the SHEF parser application.

Updated the SHEFPARM input file (in shef_data) to reflect recent updates to the

building or using the SHEF parser application.
